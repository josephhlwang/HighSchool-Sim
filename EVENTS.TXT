You're filled with indecision.

Talk to your father. 
You gather the courage to say to him, "I'll try to be happy for your sake, but I just don't know what to do." He has no response but a weak, warm smile.

As you leave, you contemplate life and what it means to you. People can easily leave your life, as your being could disappear just as easily. You somberly leave the hospital with these thoughts in your mind.
