As you walk to your next period class, you peer into a classroom and see Bill, a classmate of yours, preparing to jump.(text of the first phase, keep all phase and choice text limited to one line)
2 	(number of choices of that phase) 
Don't jump! Your life is worth more than that! (Choice 1 of phase 1)
"If only that were true" he says. (change to story, the text being added to the beginning of the next phase text)
Lean in to it, it's better for your knees. (Choice 2 of phase 1)
He looks back at you and smiles. "Thanks for the advice bud". (change to story) 
The student breaths a sigh of relief and pushes the window open. (phase text)
2 	*number of choices of second phase
Run towards Bill and pull him back.	(choice 1)
You run towards Bill, leaping over chairs and desks, but it's too late. (effect on story) 
Try to talk him out of it.	(choice 2)
"I promise you Bill", you shout, "life's worth living for!". There's no reply. (effect on story) 
You can only watch in horror as he falls forward like a sack of potatoes. You run to the window and look down. All that's left to greet you is a crumpled red stain, what remains of poor Bill.

(the last phase has no choices so just put 0, it's just phase text)
